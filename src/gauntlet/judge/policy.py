"""Deterministic policy engine — the judge's fast path (FR-7.2).

Rules are evaluated **deny-first**: any matching deny rule wins immediately,
before allow or ask rules are considered. A matched allow rule resolves to
``allow``; a matched ask rule resolves to ``ask`` (escalate to the LLM
classifier); no match returns ``None`` (also escalate). Only ``allow`` and
``deny`` are terminal fast-path outcomes.

Matchers operate on the hook payload ``{tool_name, tool_input}`` plus the run's
``repo_root``. Two matcher families:
- ``command_patterns``: regexes against the Bash command string (the primary
  surface FR-7.6 enumerates).
- structural path checks (``path_escape``, ``credential_path``): resolve the
  path a file tool (or a Bash command) touches and test it against the repo
  boundary — robust where regex on shell text is not.
