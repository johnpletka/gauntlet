## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-27

A patch release that fixes two ways the interactive operator/monitor session
(`gauntlet run --interactive`) could be left unable to act. Both are bug fixes;
existing workflows are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **The interactive operator session no longer bricks when its run ends.** The
  monitor is wired to the run's judge, which is reaped the instant the run exits
  — cleanly or, as seen live, on an early-step failure seconds in. The operator
  session was wired in the judge's default `unattended` mode, so once the judge
  was gone every operator tool call failed closed and was denied — even
  read-only diagnostics like `gauntlet status` — with a misleading "judge
  unreachable" error. `operator_session_env` now marks the session
  `interactive`, so an unreachable judge degrades to a permission prompt (the
  human operator is the backstop) instead of a total deny. A live judge's *deny*
  still denies in both modes, so this never loosens policy on a reachable judge.
- **The judge no longer denies the `gauntlet` CLI in the operator session.**
  `policy.yaml` had no fast-path rule for `gauntlet`, so the operator's own
  verbs (`status`/`logs`/`approve`/`reject`/`resume`/`abort`/`recover`/…)
  escalated to the LLM classifier, which denied them as an "untrusted external
  tool outside the repository" — blocking the operator at the commands it exists
  to run. A new `gauntlet-cli` fast-path allow rule covers the first-party CLI;
  the deny-first rules still gate the destructive git/network primitives in every
  context. Because allow rules are skipped on chained/piped/redirected commands
  (a benign prefix must not bless a dangerous trailing segment), the monitor's
  starter prompt now steers the operator to run gauntlet verbs as a single bare
  command — their output is already bounded (`logs` tails 200 lines,
  `status --json` is small), so piping is never needed.

### Notes

- **Adopters:** the `gauntlet-cli` allow rule ships in the scaffolded
  `.gauntlet/policy.yaml`; existing repos pick it up via `gauntlet upgrade` (or
  by adding the rule to their `policy.yaml`).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-27

A patch release that completes and hardens the run-supervision surface shipped
in 0.3.0. Both changes are bug fixes; existing workflows are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **`gauntlet run --watch` now opens the console in your browser.** The
  background-start-services phase (P5) had specified an authenticated
  browser-open for `--watch` but shipped only a subset of its scope — the
  browser-open (FR-1), `?p=` loopback query auth (FR-2), and `serve --resume`
  (FR-4) were never implemented. This release builds the dropped scope: `--watch`
  opens the authenticated loopback URL (degrading fail-soft to `/login`, never
  aborting the run), `serve --resume` reuses or boots a console and opens the
  browser without a foreground bind, and a new `--no-browser` flag opts out.
  Loopback `?p=<token>` query auth bootstraps the HttpOnly session cookie and is
  then stripped from the URL. (#43)
- **The interactive monitor now loads this repo's operator skill.**
  `run --interactive` / `status --interactive` launched a bare `claude` with no
  flags, so the spawned session never loaded the repo's `.claude/` project
  config and reported it could not run the `gauntlet-operator` skill. The
  monitor command now passes `--setting-sources project` for the `claude` agent
  (matching the builder/reviewer adapter profiles), bringing `.claude/skills/`
  into scope. (#44)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-27

A run-observability and supervision release. It makes an in-flight run
answerable — live log streaming, machine-readable status, a guarded recovery
path, and a one-command bridge into the console — and adds per-agent reasoning
effort control. Everything is additive; existing CLI workflows are unchanged.

### Added — operator observability & supervision (`status` / `logs` / `recover`)

- **`gauntlet status`** now reports **driver liveness**, the **computed
  run-state**, and the **next action / recovery hint**, so a glance answers
  "where is it, and does it need me?".
- **`gauntlet status --json`** emits the same state as one machine-readable
  object (schema `schemas/status.json`) for scripts and CI.
- **`gauntlet logs <slug>`** is read-only evidence-on-demand — a step's dir plus
  its transcript tail.
- **`gauntlet recover <slug>`** terminates a driver **only after verifying it is
  genuinely wedged** (identity-checked) and marks its step `INTERRUPTED` so a
  plain `resume` re-enters cleanly — it never kills a healthy run.
- **`gauntlet-operator` skill + playbook.** `gauntlet init` installs a
  project-level Claude Code skill (`prompts/operator.md`) that routes a
  supervising session to this repo's run-state triage and recovery playbook,
  propagated like every other asset.
- **Engine hardening.** A response-less terminal cycle failure now surfaces
  instead of being silently re-executed/rewritten on `resume` (with a regression
  test).

### Added — live run observability (streamed step output)

- **Streamed step output.** The CLI agents' line-delimited JSON events are now
  written to disk incrementally as they arrive (replacing the buffered drain in
  `run_with_timeout`), so an in-flight step has a live, redacted, tailable log.
  Claude + Codex adapters; the API/LiteLLM adapter is a durable non-goal.
  Streaming ships behind a **default-off** flag.
- **`gauntlet logs --follow`** tails a running step's `events.jsonl` live.
- **Advisory freshness signal.** `status` / `status --json` expose
  `current_step_freshness.last_event_age_s` so a stalled step is visible.

### Added — background service startup & the interactive run monitor

- **`gauntlet run --watch`** ensures the supervisory console is running
  (boot/reuse) and prints its URL before running in the foreground;
  `--console-host` / `--console-port` override the bind.
- **`gauntlet run --interactive[=claude|codex]`** launches the run **detached**
  and hands the terminal to an interactive monitoring agent, wired to the run's
  judge as the **operator's own session** (judge-gated without prompt spam);
  **`gauntlet status --interactive`** attaches the same monitor to an
  already-running run.
- **Per-run `judge.json`** (gitignored — endpoint + process identity) lets
  `abort` / `finish` / `clean` reap an **orphaned per-run judge** by verified
  identity; the shared console is never killed.

### Added — per-agent reasoning effort

- **`claude-code`** profiles accept an optional `effort`
  (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`, passed as `--effort`), and **`codex`**
  profiles accept `reasoning_effort` (passed as `-c model_reasoning_effort=…`).
  Both are optional and no-op when absent — existing configs are unaffected — so
  a cheaper `fixer:` role can run review-fix rounds while `builder` runs higher.

### Changed — the wired judge hook tolerates a missing install

`gauntlet init` now wires the PreToolUse judge hook as an **install-tolerant
launcher** instead of the bare `gauntlet-judge-hook` console script, so a repo can
mix Gauntlet and non-Gauntlet developers without the latter seeing hook errors. The
launcher:

- **execs the real hook when it's installed** — the permission decision and exit
  code (including the exit-2 deny) and the `GAUNTLET_RUN_ID` gating pass through
  unchanged, so gating is byte-identical to before;
- **stays silent (exit 0) for a teammate who never installed Gauntlet**, instead of
  emitting a per-tool-call `command not found` hook-error notice on every call; and
- **fails closed (exit 2) only when the hook is missing during an active run**
  (`GAUNTLET_RUN_ID` set), so a broken install can never let a run proceed ungated.

A re-run upgrades an existing bare-command wiring in place (idempotent; a
hand-customized wrapping is left untouched), and `gauntlet doctor` recognizes both
forms while still FAILing when the console script is absent on a Gauntlet user's
PATH. The launcher is POSIX sh (macOS/Linux/WSL2 — native-Windows users follow the
README's WSL2 path).

### Added — PRD-authoring aids (the repo teaches its own PRD conventions)

Two committable aids make a fresh session — human or Claude — start PRD authoring
from the right shape instead of from tribal knowledge. Both propagate via
`gauntlet init` like every other asset, so a teammate who clones the repo
inherits them (FR-1.2).

- **PRD-authoring skill.** `gauntlet init` installs a project-level Claude Code
  skill at `.claude/skills/gauntlet-prd-author/SKILL.md`. It triggers on
  natural-language PRD intent ("write/draft/author a PRD", "start a Gauntlet
  run") and routes the session to this repo's playbook and conventions. It is a
  **thin pointer** to `prompts/prd-author.md` (resolved under the repo's
  `asset_root`) — never a copy — so the single instruction source can't drift.
  The playbook reference is repository-relative, so the committed skill keeps
  resolving after a clone or copy to a different absolute path.
- **Structured `gauntlet new` stub.** The PRD stub is now one committable
  template (`<asset_root>/prd-stub.md`) carrying the playbook's full section
  skeleton plus one-line guidance per section. Both `gauntlet new` and the
  `gauntlet run` entry-contract gate resolve the *same* template (repo copy if
  present, else the packaged default), so they can never disagree about what an
  unfilled stub is.
- **The human-author gate is unchanged and hardened.** The richer stub keeps the
  FR-10.1 marker, and a deterministic authored-content predicate rejects every
  trivial edit (whitespace-, comment-, or heading-only). Because the stub
  template is now a gate input, both consumers validate it against template
  invariants (exactly one marker, every mandatory section, required metadata
  labels) and **fail closed** — a malformed customization can't silently disable
  the gate.
- **Idempotent, never-clobber propagation.** A re-run creates whichever aid is
  missing, refreshes an *unmodified generated* file to the current template after
  a version bump, and never overwrites a customization. `gauntlet init
  --from-repo` reports each aid as present / missing / customized without
  writing. Malformed pre-existing state (a non-regular or symlinked destination)
  fails the run closed before any write.
- **Committability + `doctor` check.** `init` warns (without editing the rule) if
  a foreign ignore source — repo/parent `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, or the
  global `core.excludesFile` — would exclude the skill from git. `gauntlet doctor`
  gains a **warn-only** skill check (the skill gates nothing, so it never FAILs):
  it warns when the skill is missing, malformed against the pinned frontmatter
  schema, or its provenance looks stale.
- **`gauntlet new` pointer (OQ-4).** `gauntlet new` now prints a CLI-agnostic
  pointer to the playbook and skill, reinforcing the convention outside a
  skill-aware Claude session.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-19

A significant feature release. The headline is the **Gauntlet Console** — a
local-first web UI that makes every run visible, answerable, and recoverable —
alongside a hardened judge security posture, the run-branch lifecycle, and
smarter project setup. Everything is additive; existing CLI workflows are
unchanged.

### Added — Gauntlet Console (supervisory web UI)

`gauntlet serve` starts a loopback-only, token-authenticated console that runs
strictly *above* the orchestrator — every control action launches the same
sanctioned `gauntlet` CLI verb a human would type, so it inherits every existing
safety invariant rather than being able to weaken one.

- **Run list & detail.** Lists every run across all slugs (sortable, filterable,
  searchable) with live status, current step, and cost; per-run detail renders
  the full step tree, per-step status/duration/cost, and an owned/observed badge.
- **Live updates.** A ~1 s manifest poll emits edge-triggered transitions over
  SSE — no manual refresh — via a ~30-line vendored vanilla-JS shim (no HTMX, no
  build step, no new dependency).
- **Step drill-down.** Open any step's `prompt.md`, `transcript.md` (rendered
  markdown), and `events.jsonl`, including artifacts nested in round / sub-step
  dirs (cycle review/triage/confirm, retrospective builder/reviewer/synthesis,
  per-finding triage verdicts). Live log tailing for running steps.
- **Human-gate review.** When a run parks at a gate, the console assembles the
  decision's evidence — findings/triage as readable tables, rendered artifacts,
  and a deterministic phase diff — and offers **Approve / Reject** in one place.
- **Cycle-escalation reconciliation.** Parks *inside* an adversarial cycle
  (upstream-invalidation, open-blocker, max-rounds) are surfaced with their
  escalated findings, triage verdicts, and the named upstream artifact, framed
  as a reconcile-then-resume decision — previously invisible and un-notified.
- **Failure diagnosis & recovery.** A pure classifier maps each parked/halted/
  failed state to the action that actually applies — Resume where it helps, and
  an honest "resume won't fix this" with guidance (raise the timeout/budget,
  reconcile the artifact) where it won't.
- **Supervised runs.** Launch and abort runs as managed subprocess children of
  the CLI, with captured logs and crash survival: a server restart re-discovers
  owned runs and re-attaches to live PIDs (PID-reuse-safe), and an orphaned run
  is offered for resume exactly like a `kill -9`'d one.
- **Notifications.** Fire on the four moments that need a human — gate reached,
  escalation parked, run failed, run completed — to macOS desktop, Slack, and
  in-tab, edge-triggered and fail-soft (a notification error can never affect a
  run).
- **Durable auth & ergonomics.** A one-time `/login` token exchange sets an
  `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` session cookie with per-session CSRF on every
  state-changing POST; full run-history browsing per slug; cost report and
  judge-audit views; `gauntlet run --watch` boots/reuses a console for the run.
- **Read-only proposals view** for a run's retrospective improvement proposals
  (review/apply stays the `gauntlet proposals review` CLI verb).
- **Opt-in analysis hand-off** (`gauntlet serve --enable-handoff`): assembles a
  copy-pasteable, read-only prompt for a parked decision — the console itself
  makes no model call and spawns nothing.

### Added — engine & tooling

- **Run-branch lifecycle:** `base:current` resolution, a stale-branch guard,
  `gauntlet clean`, and `gauntlet finish` (merge a completed run via PR), with
  fail-closed resume / clean / base resolution.
- **Worktree-scoped active-run lock (FR-10.5):** a repo/worktree advisory lock
  fail-closes `start` / `resume` / `approve` across *all* slugs in a worktree,
  so two orchestrators can never drive one worktree. Parallel runs across
  *different* repos are unaffected.
- **`gauntlet init`** now detects the per-project test command.
- **Run-id handshake** (`gauntlet run --run-id`) lets a supervisor pre-allocate
  a run's id; the env-var form was dropped to avoid colliding with the judge's
  `GAUNTLET_RUN_ID`.

### Security

- **Context-aware push/PR policy.** The operator may `git push` and
  `gh pr create`/read; in-run agents are denied. Force-pushing and direct merges
  to `main`/`master` remain denied for everyone.
- **Judge gated on run context** (an active `RUN_ID`), not mere token presence,
  so an ambient token can't pull an unrelated session under judge control.
- Engine-managed judge **avoids port clashes** and reuses an existing judge
  rather than failing to bind.
- **Warns loudly** when the judge LLM classifier is disabled.
- Stale `triage.json` is cleared between rounds to prevent phantom escalations.

### Fixed

- Baseline-commit guard missed an artifact under the nested run layout.
- Numerous review-hardening fixes across the judge, resume/clean/base paths, and
  the console (path containment, fail-closed gate evidence, the active-run lock's
  unverifiable-identity handling, console registry startup race, and FR-5.3
  control gating).

### Notes

- **Dependencies:** `httpx` and `jinja2` promoted from transitive to explicit
  `pyproject.toml` dependencies; no new heavy runtime dependency.
- **Engine surface:** the console adds exactly one sanctioned engine change (the
  worktree active-run lock); everything else reads on-disk state or shells out to
  CLI verbs.
